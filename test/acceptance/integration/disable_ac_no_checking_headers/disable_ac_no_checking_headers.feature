  Send requests for cb plugin

  Background:
    Given the Context Broker configuration with Access Control and check headers functionality disabled

  Scenario: A user with roles in Keystone but not in AC and with headers response ok without get AC
    Given a KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION with roles not in Access Control
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"
    And set the request URL with the path "/v1/queryContext"
    And add an example of PAYLOAD with "json" format
    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    When the request built before is sent to PEP
    Then the petition gets to the mock
    And the access control proxy receive the last petition "" from PEP
    And the PEP returns an ok

  Scenario Outline: A user with roles in Keystone but not in AC and without header, response ok without get AC
