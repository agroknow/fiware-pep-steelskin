Feature: PeP cache in user, project and roles

  Background:
    Given the keystone proxy history reset

  Scenario: Test cache with the same token
    Given the cache gradual configuration
    And a KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION with all roles in the same project
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"
    And set the request URL with the path "/v1/queryContext"
    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    When the request built before is sent to PEP
    And the history is saved
    And the request built before is sent to PEP
    Then the PEP returns an ok
    And the history is the same as saved
    And waits "35" seconds to "all" cache expire

  Scenario: Test cache with different tokens
    Given the cache gradual configuration
    And a KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION with all roles in the same project
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"
    And set the request URL with the path "/v1/queryContext"
    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    When the request built before is sent to PEP
    And the history is saved
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"
    And set the request URL with the path "/v1/queryContext"
    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    And the request built before is sent to PEP
    Then the PEP returns an ok
    And the history of petitions adds "1" petition
    And waits "35" seconds to "all" cache expire

  Scenario: Test cache user expired
    Given the cache gradual configuration
    And a KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION with all roles in the same project
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"
    And set the request URL with the path "/v1/queryContext"
    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    When the request built before is sent to PEP
    And the history is saved
    And waits "10" seconds to "all" cache expire
    And the request built before is sent to PEP
    Then the PEP returns an ok
    And the history of petitions adds "1" petition
    And waits "35" seconds to "all" cache expire

  Scenario: Test cache user and projects expired
    Given the cache gradual configuration
    And a KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION with all roles in the same project
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"
    And set the request URL with the path "/v1/queryContext"
    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    When the request built before is sent to PEP
    And the history is saved
    And waits "20" seconds to "all" cache expire
    And the request built before is sent to PEP
    Then the PEP returns an ok
    And the history of petitions adds "2" petition
    And waits "35" seconds to "all" cache expire

  Scenario: Test cache expired completed
    Given the cache gradual configuration
    And a KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION with all roles in the same project
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"
    And set the request URL with the path "/v1/queryContext"
    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    When the request built before is sent to PEP
    And the history is saved
    And waits "30" seconds to "all" cache expire
    And the request built before is sent to PEP
    Then the PEP returns an ok
    And the history of petitions adds "3" petition
    And waits "35" seconds to "all" cache expire

  Scenario: Test cache projects expired
    Given the cache projects configuration
    And a KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION with all roles in the same project
    And set the request HEADERS with the previous KEYSTONE CONFIGURATION ant the format "json"

    And set the request METHOD as "POST"
    When the request built before is sent to PEP
    And the history is saved
